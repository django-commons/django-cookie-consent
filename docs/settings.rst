The cookie settings (name, max-age, domain...) follow the same principles like
Django's built-in session cookie. For more details, please check that documenation
for more details about the meaning.

``COOKIE_CONSENT_NAME``
  name of consent cookie that remembers user choice

  Default: ``cookie_consent``.

``COOKIE_CONSENT_MAX_AGE``
  max-age of consent cookie, in seconds

  Default: 1 year

``COOKIE_CONSENT_DOMAIN``
  Domain to restrict the cookie to.

  Default: ``None``

``COOKIE_CONSENT_SECURE``
  Whether to only set the cookie in an HTTPS context.

  Default: ``False``

``COOKIE_CONSENT_HTTPONLY``
  Whether access from Javascript is blocked.

  Default: ``True``

``COOKIE_CONSENT_SAMESITE``
  The SameSite policy. Possible values are ``"Strict"``, ``"Lax"``, ``"None"`` or
  ``False`` to disable setting the flag.

  Default: ``"Lax"``

``COOKIE_CONSENT_DECLINE``
  decline value
  Default: ``-1``

``COOKIE_CONSENT_ENABLED``
  boolean or callable that receives request and return boolean.

  IE if you want to enable cookie consent for debug or staff only::

    COOKIE_CONSENT_ENABLED = lambda r: DEBUG or (r.user.is_authenticated() and r.user.is_staff)

  Default: ``True``

``COOKIE_CONSENT_OPT_OUT``
  Boolean value represents if cookies are opt-in or opt-out.
  Opt-out cookies are set until declined.
  Opt-in cookies are set only if accepted.

  Default: ``False``

``COOKIE_CONSENT_CACHE_BACKEND``
  Alias for backend to use for caching.

  Default: ``default``

``COOKIE_CONSENT_LOG_ENABLED``
  Boolean value represents if user actions when they accepting and declining cookies will be logged. Turning it off might be useful for preventing your database from getting filled up with log items.

  Default: ``True`` 

``COOKIE_CONSENT_SUCCESS_URL``
  The success URL to redirect the user too after a successful accept/decline action. If
  a ``?next`` parameter is present in the request, then it takes priority over this
  setting. Defaults to the URL of the built-in cookie list view.
